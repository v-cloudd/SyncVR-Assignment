This app displays the numbers in the Fibonacci sequence as a grid, in a 3D environment. When thinking of ways to show the sequence I wanted to go for a more viual and easy to follow approach, that could show the way it progresses. Because of that I felt that displaying the numbers as squares would be an appropriate choice. The app could be further developed by zooming out the panel to display larger numbers or by adding a grid showing subdivisions in the background, as well as by updating it to the new input system.

Instructions:
Move the mouse or swipe to move the camera. Press the button to show the next number in the Fibonacci sequence.
